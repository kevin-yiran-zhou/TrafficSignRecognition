  (To save data loading time and training time, we only took 10% of training and testing data.)

- ## To reproduce the results
  - ## ResNet: by Kevin Zhou
      - Download or copy GTSRB_ResNet.ipynb from this repo.
      - Create a shortcut to [our dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1N-OytOWJ3XINY1_IB4xqNXw96dcKG2-r?usp=sharing) on your Google Drive.
      - Put the dataset shortcut and .ipynb file in the same folder on your Google Drive
      - You may need to change the GOOGLE_DRIVE_PATH depending on where you put them.
      - Run .ipynb file
  - ## YOLOv5: by Zheng Wang
